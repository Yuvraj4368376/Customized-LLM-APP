# RAG LLM Chatbot

This repository contains the code for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using a language model. The chatbot leverages external documents to provide more accurate and relevant responses.

## Overview

The application utilizes the following key components:

- **Gradio**: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Huggingface_hub**: To load pre-trained models from Hugging Face.
- **PyMuPDF**: To handle PDF documents.
- **Sentence-Transformers**: For embedding sentences and documents.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Faiss-cpu**: For efficient similarity search.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-llm-chatbot.git
    cd rag-llm-chatbot
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
